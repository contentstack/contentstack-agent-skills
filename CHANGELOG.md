# Changelog

All notable changes to the Contentstack agent skills bundle. Versions match the `version` field in every plugin manifest.

## 0.2.0

### Install anywhere, from one source

- Every skill now lives once in `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` ([Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format), and every supported tool reads that folder directly.
- New and updated plugin manifests: Claude Code, claude.ai and Cowork (`.claude-plugin/`), Codex (`plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), Cursor (`.cursor-plugin/`), GitHub Copilot (reads `.claude-plugin/` and `plugin.json`) and Gemini CLI (`gemini-extension.json`).
- The marketplace plugin source is now `"./"`, so the repo syncs on claude.ai and Cowork.
- The README has real install commands for every tool, and a new `docs/` site covers install, architecture, contributing and every skill.

### New skills

- `dx-kickstart-next`: building, reviewing and debugging Contentstack's Next.js kickstart.
- `studio`: Contentstack Studio end to end, routed to bundled specialist guides.

### Changed skills

- **Live Preview support is rebuilt** as a seven-step diagnostic protocol covering Live Preview, Visual Editor and Timeline, with twelve reference files.
- **`migration-companion` is leaner.** Its `SKILL.md` went from 959 to about 340 lines; per-step detail now lives in `references/step-*.md` and loads only when that step runs.
- **Better automatic triggering.** Every skill's `description` now says when to use it, so agents can pick the right skill without a separate router file.

### Breaking changes

- **Removed `cursor/rules/` and `codex/`.** If you copied those folders by hand, remove them and install with the Cursor or Codex instructions in the README.
- **Renamed** `cms-live-preview-visual-builder-support-assistant` → `cms-live-preview-visual-editor-support-assistant`.
- **Skill names now match their folders:** `contentstack-migration-companion` → `migration-companion`, and `contentstack-kickstart-next` → `dx-kickstart-next`.
- **Removed `skills/CLAUDE.md`** (the router) and `manifest.json`.

### Contributors

- **Validation in CI:** `node scripts/validate.mjs` checks skill names, descriptions, links in every skill file and manifest versions, and replaces the build-and-commit workflow.
- **Releases:** bump `version` in every manifest and add an entry here.

## 0.1.0

Initial bundle of 21 skills.
